# Review

Once you have your lists of selections for each of your River Styles and Conditions, it is useful to view the GUT output maps of to make sure that the reaches chosen are similar in character to your reaches. You will want to throw out any sites within each grouping that don't fit before moving on to [estimating]({{ site.baseurl }}/4.Estimating) geomorphic assemblages. If the selections just seem off as a whole or you would like greater numbers, you will want to go back and revise your initial [selection]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.Selecting). If the streams from the database just seem too dissimilar to your River Style and Condition, then be aware that the geomorphic assemblage estimates fo that River Style may not reflect reality for your situation. You may consider just upscaling the reaches where the selections decently the mimic geomorphic character of your River Styles.

Tier2 and Tier3 GUT maps without contours can be accessed in the Database folder. To ease the review process, the script  [*MapsbyRSselection.R*](https://github.com/natalie-kramer/GeomorphicUpscale/blob/master/scripts/MapsbyRSselection.R) will copy maps from databse folders to separate folders in your local directory that correspond to your River Style and Condition categories.

## What's next?
Once you are happy with your [selections]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.Selecting)  and they are saved in your local directory (see example data [*Asotinselections.csv*](https://github.com/natalie-kramer/GeomorphicUpscale/blob/master/ExampleData/Asotinselections.csv)) You are now ready to [Estimate]({{ site.baseurl }}/4.Estimating) using your selections output.
