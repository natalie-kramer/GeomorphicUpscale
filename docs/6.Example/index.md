#Upscaling

You are now ready to upscale your estimates to the river network!

##Under Construction!!!


##What's next?
You are now ready to analyze your results and decide if they make any sense. If they don't, maybe you need to familiarize yourself with the data to make sure the base dataset could be used as a reasonable proxy for your streams. Or, perhaps better selections could have been made to increase sample size or eliminate outliers.  Perhaps you need to review maps of the data to make sure that reaches selected are appropriate or that there aren't mistakes or mis-mapped landforms in the data.  Do you believe in the modelling efforts?  Do you think they tell a story that reflects reality? Are the numbers off but the patterns and trends fairly reasonable? Good luck!
