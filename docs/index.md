## About

Welcome to Geomorphic Upscale. This site provides documentation for how to upscale reach  NREI and HSI capacity estimates to the network scale utilizing a base dataset of 112 GUT runs for coarse bed streams of diverse geomorphic character  throughout the Columbia River Basin, USA.

The basic process is:

1. [Familiarize]({{ site.baseurl }}/1.Background)  yourself with the base dataset to make sure that they stream characteristics are similar to the network you are trying to upscale. 
2. [Select]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.Selecting) similar sites based on River Style geoindicators
3. [Review]({{ site.baseurl }}/3.Viewing) selections. 
4. [Estimate]({{ site.baseurl }}/4.Estimating) geomorphic assemblages and responses by geomorphic unit 
5. [Upscale]({{ site.baseurl }}/3.GUTAlgorithms/index) estimates to the network based on River Style and Condition. ({{ site.baseurl }}/3.GUTAlgorithms/index)

*The website is still under construction but will be fully populated shortly.  In the meantime, if you have questions or want to run the code, please contact Natalie Kramer (n.kramer.anderson@gmail.com).*
