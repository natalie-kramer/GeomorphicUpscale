## About

Welcome to Geomorphic Upscale. This site provides documentation for how to upscale reach  NREI and HSI capacity estimates to the network scale utilizing a base dataset of 112 GUT runs for coarse bed streams of diverse geomorphic character  throughout the Columbia River Basin, USA.

The basic process is:

1. [Familiarize] yourself with the base dataset to make sure that they stream characteristics are similar to the network you are trying to upscale. ({{ site.baseurl }}/1.Background) 
2. [Select] similar sites based on River Style geoindicators ({{ site.baseurl }}/2.Selecting)
3. [Review] selections. ({{ site.baseurl }}/3.Viewing)
4. [Estimate] geomorphic assemblages and responses by geomorphic unit ({{ site.baseurl }}/4.Estimating)
5. [Upscale] estimates to the network based on River Style and Condition. ({{ site.baseurl }}/3.GUTAlgorithms/index)

*The website is still under construction but will be fully populated shortly.  In the meantime, if you have questions or want to run the code, please contact Natalie Kramer (n.kramer.anderson@gmail.com).*
