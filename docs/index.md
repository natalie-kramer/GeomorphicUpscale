## About

Welcome to Geomorphic Upscale. This site provides documentation for how to upscale reach  NREI and HSI capacity estimates to the network scale utilizing a base dataset of 112 GUT runs for coarse bed streams of diverse geomorphic character  throughout the Columbia River Basin, USA.

The basic process is:

1. [Familiarize](familiarizing.md)  yourself with the base dataset to make sure that the stream characteristics in your network are similar to those in the base database.. 
2. [Select and Review](selecting.md) similar sites based on River Style geoindicators using [RSselection.R]()
3. [Upscale](upscaling.md) geomorphic assemblages and responses by geomorphic using [UpscaleWrapper.R]()

We document an [example](example.md) for the Asotin Basin for your reference.

*The website is still under construction but will be fully populated shortly.  In the meantime, if you have questions or want to run the code, please contact Natalie Kramer (n.kramer.anderson@gmail.com).*
